# Employee-Attrition-Analysis-Report

### Overview

As part of my ongoing training with The Incubator Hub in Power BI, our class was provided with a HR dataset to analyze and uncover insights through visualization. I'm excited to share my findings from this exercise, which focuses on employee attrition. Below are the key insights and recommendations that emerged from my analysis, aimed at informing strategic decisions and driving business outcomes.


#### Key Insights

- *Attrition Rate*: Our analysis reveals an attrition rate of 16.12%, indicating a significant opportunity for improvement.

- *Departmental Attrition*: The *Sales department* has the highest attrition rate (20.63%), followed by *HR* (19.05%).

- *Job Role Attrition*: *Sales Representatives* have the highest attrition rate (39.76%), highlighting a critical area for focus.

- *Job Satisfaction*: Current employees report higher job satisfaction (2.78) compared to ex-employees (2.47), suggesting a correlation between job satisfaction and attrition.

#### Recommendations

Based on these insights, I recommend the following:

- *Improve Job Satisfaction*: Develop and implement initiatives to enhance job satisfaction, particularly in departments with high attrition rates.

- *Targeted Retention Strategies*: Design and implement targeted retention strategies for high-risk job roles, such as Sales Representatives.

- *Departmental Interventions*: Collaborate with department leaders to develop and implement department-specific interventions to address attrition drivers.

#### Conclusion

The findings of this analysis provide a critical foundation for informing strategic decisions and driving business outcomes. By addressing the root causes of attrition and implementing targeted interventions, we can reduce turnover, improve job satisfaction, and enhance overall workforce stability.
